## Installation

An account of how to install and deploy `cmed` on the machine.


## Usage

A detailed description on how to use `cmed`.


## Development

This program relies on Python version 3.10 and later.

To get the development environment up and running, first, create Python virtual
environment with this `venv` command:

```sh
python3.10 -m venv .
```

Acitivate (and deactivate) the virtual environment with the following commands:

```sh
. bin/activate
deactivate
```

Install the package in the editable mode alongside all of its development
dependencies and upgrade `pip` with `make`:

```sh
make install
```

Type annotation checking, code formatting and automatic testing can be initiated
with the following `make` command:

```sh
make test
```

Use `pre-commit` to run the CI routine when committing code to VCS by
installing it with `pre-commit install`. You can manualy run the routine with
`pre-commit run`.

Consult [Makefile](Makefile) for further details.
